# MIPS-Instruction Formats

R: operation - 3 Registers - no immediate                                             
I: operation - 2 Registers - 16bit immediate                                     
J: jump     - 0 Registers - 26bit immediate                                             

# Random Notes on MIPS

Register Memory is fast but small while memory is big but slow. 

R -> 32 bits 
M -> 8 bits   

Therefore in memory level each 4*8bits is called as 4k. Like 0, 4 ,8 , 12...........
